# WeatherTracker

The purpose of this assignment is to use API's to retrieve data for the weather for a city and the forecast for the upcoming days at noon.
This assignment also tests us on jquery elements to lay the page and functions.
I organized my page by having the functions before the then function are called at the bottom of the js file for organizations sake.
Users will be able to input a city of their choosing to obtain the local weather and forecast.

I use the object properties to obtain the information that I need to be printed out because the api for the forecast only takes the city's latitude and longitude.
So from there I used the values from the first api to then input it into the second api in order to get the rest of the information.
Such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed accompanied by an image to represent the weather at that time.

I will also have a localStorage area so I can implement a history function to the right side of the page.
